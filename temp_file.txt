Num of peers: 5 and num of entries: 5.
Initial array of entry structs is:
Entry 1:
	value = 1
	semaphore key = 1
Entry 2:
	value = 2
	semaphore key = 2
Entry 3:
	value = 3
	semaphore key = 3
Entry 4:
	value = 4
	semaphore key = 4
Entry 5:
	value = 5
	semaphore key = 5

Write at entry 1 with process pid 461
Write at entry 0 with process pid 462
Write at entry 3 with process pid 463
Write at entry 2 with process pid 464
Write at entry 3 with process pid 462
Write at entry 0 with process pid 461
Write at entry 2 with process pid 463
Write at entry 1 with process pid 464
Read entry 1 with value= 4 with process pid 465

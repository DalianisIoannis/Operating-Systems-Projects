Execution of peers:
Read entry 2 with value = 2 with process pid 1405
Write 99 at entry 2 with process pid 1405
Read entry 4 with value = 4 with process pid 1405
Read entry 2 with value = 99 with process pid 1407
Read entry 2 with value = 99 with process pid 1406
Write 99 at entry 2 with process pid 1407
Read entry 4 with value = 4 with process pid 1407
Write 99 at entry 2 with process pid 1406
Read entry 4 with value = 4 with process pid 1406

For peer 1405 total time counted is 0.000008, readings done are 2, writes done are 2 and average time is 0.000001.

Write 76 at entry 3 with process pid 1407
For peer 1407 total time counted is 0.000042, readings done are 2, writes done are 2 and average time is 0.000007.

Write 76 at entry 3 with process pid 1406
For peer 1406 total time counted is 0.000022, readings done are 2, writes done are 2 and average time is 0.000004.

Write 76 at entry 3 with process pid 1408
For peer 1408 total time counted is 0.000022, readings done are 2, writes done are 2 and average time is 0.000004.

Write 76 at entry 3 with process pid 1409
For peer 1409 total time counted is 0.000043, readings done are 2, writes done are 2 and average time is 0.000007.

Write 76 at entry 3 with process pid 1410

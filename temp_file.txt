Num of peers: 5 and num of entries: 5.
Initial array of entry structs is:
Entry 1:
	value = 1
	read and write semaphore key = -1
	mutual exclusion semaphore key = -1
	reads made = 0
	writes made = 0
Entry 2:
	value = 2
	read and write semaphore key = -1
	mutual exclusion semaphore key = -1
	reads made = 0
	writes made = 0
Entry 3:
	value = 3
	read and write semaphore key = -1
	mutual exclusion semaphore key = -1
	reads made = 0
	writes made = 0
Entry 4:
	value = 4
	read and write semaphore key = -1
	mutual exclusion semaphore key = -1
	reads made = 0
	writes made = 0
Entry 5:
	value = 5
	read and write semaphore key = -1
	mutual exclusion semaphore key = -1
	reads made = 0
	writes made = 0

Execution of peers:
Write 69 at entry 3 with process pid 3696
Read entry 4 with value = 4 with process pid 3696
Write 17 at entry 2 with process pid 3696
Write 1 at entry 4 with process pid 3696
For peer 3696 time counted is 0.000468.
